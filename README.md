After:
 - a few very frustrating hours dealing with the unintuitive and sometimes even failing Everlast Round Timer
 - knowing that I could not use my own phone as it will be playing music during kickboxing sessions 
 - having a spare [Firefox Developer Preview Phone](https://marketplace.firefox.com/developers/dev_phone) thanks
to a lucky raffle on [Decode Friday](http://www.meetup.com/DecodeFriday/events/119848052/)
 - knowing that building Firefox OS apps is as easy as creating a simple website
 
I decided to use my geekphone as a dedicated interval timer / instruction guide to help give kickboxing training
using this app.

Hacked this up in 1 Sunday thanks to a headstart with https://github.com/robnyman/Firefox-OS-Boilerplate-App.

This project is **Very** specific to my use-case but open sourced for inspiration 
and so that I can more easily install it :)
